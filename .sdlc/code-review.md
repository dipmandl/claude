# Code Review: CS-50

## Verdict
APPROVED

## Summary
The implementation faithfully follows the design contracts in all dimensions. The three new functions (`deleteRelease`, `startEditRelease`, `cancelEdit`) match their specified signatures, step-by-step contracts, and edge-case handling. DOM rendering is exclusively via `.textContent` and `setAttribute` — no XSS surface. All `type="button"` attributes are present, per-card `aria-label` values are set at render time, and focus management is implemented. CSS leverages all required design-system tokens, `gap` is added to `.form-actions`, and mobile overrides are inside the media-query block. No new dependencies or build steps were introduced. One cosmetic note about smooth-scroll/focus ordering is called out below.

## Findings

### [Severity: NOTE] `scrollIntoView` + immediate `focus()` may produce conflicting scroll behaviour
**File:** `claude/product_release_dashboard/script.js` : lines 103–104
**Issue:** `releaseForm.scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth", block: "nearest" })` is immediately followed by `document.getElementById("product").focus()`. Programmatic `focus()` can trigger its own scroll, which in some browsers (notably Firefox) will interrupt or conflict with the in-progress smooth scroll, producing a visual jump rather than a smooth animation.
**Recommendation:** Pass `{ preventScroll: true }` to `.focus()` and rely on `scrollIntoView` for positioning:
```js
document.getElementById("product").focus({ preventScroll: true });
releaseForm.scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth", block: "nearest" });
```

### [Severity: NOTE] `.btn-cancel` silently relies on CSS specificity to restore border
**File:** `claude/product_release_dashboard/styles.css` : lines 157, 287–292
**Issue:** The base `button` selector sets `border: 0`. `.btn-cancel` overrides this with `border: 1px solid var(--border)`. The override works correctly, but the coupling is implicit.
**Recommendation:** Safe as-is. If refactored, consider adding `/* overrides base button border: 0 */` next to the `.btn-cancel` border declaration for clarity.

## Checklist

| Dimension | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Correctness | PASS | `editingId` guard placed before filter; `cancelEdit()` called after edit save; all design-contract steps implemented |
| Security | PASS | All user data written via `.textContent` or `setAttribute`; no `.innerHTML` with user content |
| Code Quality | PASS | Plain function declarations; no classes/modules; no dead code; `cancelEdit` is the single cleanup path |
| Accessibility | PASS | Per-card `aria-label` set at render time; `type="button"` on all new buttons; `focus()` called in `startEditRelease` |
| CSS | PASS | All required design tokens used; `gap: 8px` on `.form-actions`; mobile overrides inside `@media` block |

## Approval Decision
APPROVED — no BLOCKER or MAJOR findings. Two NOTE-level observations that do not block delivery.
